# Introduction

The Aurelia Direct Router is the original and fully featured Aurelia v2 router. Its goal is to make Aurelia routing as painless and boilerplate-free a possible while at the same time provide useful and time-saving features. It might later be added back into the core of Aurelia 2.

This documentation isnâ€™t caught up yet, but {% page-ref page="./routing/configuration-and-setup.md" %} is accurate. As this router is and will continue to be well maintained the documentation should shortly be fully in order.
