# Routing

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that in Aurelia2 there are two routers, namely `@aurelia/router` (this one) and [`@aurelia/router-lite`](../router-lite/README.md). As the name suggests the second one is smaller in size, supports only configured routing, and does not support direct routing, as facilitated by `@aurelia/router`. Choose your router depending on your need.
{% endhint %}

To save time, we have provided some links to common areas of the routing documentation you might be looking for.
