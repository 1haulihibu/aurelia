In this article, we will show you how to download and use StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite software for your robot system. You will need a PC with Windows 10 operating system and an internet connection to access the software download page.
 
## Step 1: Download StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite Software
 
To download StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite software, you need to visit the official website of StÃ¤ubli Robotics at [https://www.staubli.com/us/en/robotics/products/robot-software/staeubli-robotics-suite.html](https://www.staubli.com/us/en/robotics/products/robot-software/staeubli-robotics-suite.html). There, you will find a link to download the latest version of the software. You will also need to fill in a form with your personal and professional information to request a license key for the software. After submitting the form, you will receive an email with the license key and a link to download the software installer.
 
Once you have downloaded the installer, run it on your PC and follow the instructions to install StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite software. You will need to enter the license key when prompted during the installation process. The installation may take several minutes depending on your PC configuration and internet speed.
 
## Step 2: Launch StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite Software
 
After installing StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite software, you can launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see a welcome screen with several options to start working with your robot system. You can choose to create a new project, open an existing project, or browse through some tutorials and examples.
 
A project is a collection of files that define your robot system configuration, such as robot model, controller type, communication settings, program code, simulation parameters, etc. You can create multiple projects for different robot systems or applications. To create a new project, click on the "New Project" button and follow the wizard to select your robot model and controller type. You can also import an existing project from another PC or device by clicking on the "Open Project" button and browsing for the project file.
 
## Step 3: Simulate Your Robot System
 
One of the main features of StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite software is the ability to simulate your robot system in a realistic 3D environment. This allows you to test and validate your robot program before deploying it on the real robot. You can also use simulation to optimize your robot performance, detect errors, troubleshoot issues, and visualize your robot movements.
 
To simulate your robot system, you need to switch to the "Simulation" mode by clicking on the "Simulation" tab at the top of the screen. There, you will see a 3D view of your robot system and a toolbar with various simulation tools. You can use these tools to control the simulation speed, pause and resume the simulation, record and replay the simulation, change the camera angle and zoom level, etc.
 
You can also interact with your robot system in simulation by using the mouse or keyboard commands. For example, you can drag and drop objects in the 3D environment, move or rotate them with the mouse wheel or arrow keys, or attach them to your robot tool with a click. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to move your robot joints or tool center point (TCP) along different axes.
 
## Step 4: Program Your Robot System
 
Another main feature of StÃ¤ubli Robotics Suite software is the ability to program your robot system using a graphical user interface (GUI) or a text editor. You can use either method depending on your preference and skill level. The GUI allows you to create your robot program by dragging and dropping icons that represent different commands or functions. The text editor allows you to write your robot program using VAL3 language, which is a high-level programming language designed for StÃ¤ubli robots.
